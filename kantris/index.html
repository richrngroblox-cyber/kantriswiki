            <h2>CASE FILE #001: THE SOMERTON MAN (TAMAM SHUD)</h2>
            <hr>

            <h4>I. THE DISCOVERY</h4>
            <p>At <b>6:30 AM on December 1, 1948</b>, two apprentices found a body slumped against the seawall on Somerton Park beach, Adelaide, South Australia. The man appeared to be in his 40s, in top physical condition. He was dressed in high-quality clothing: a white shirt, a red and blue tie, brown trousers, socks, and shoes. Despite the heat, he wore a brown pullover and a double-breasted coat.</p>
            
            <p><b>The First Anomalies:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Tags:</b> Every single identification tag on his clothing had been meticulously cut away.</li>
                <li><b>The Pockets:</b> He carried no wallet, no cash, and no ID. He had a pack of Army Club cigarettes containing "Kensitas" cigarettes, matches, a metal comb, and an unused train ticket.</li>
                <li><b>The Posture:</b> A half-smoked cigarette was resting on his collar.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>II. THE AUTOPSY & THE POISON</h4>
            <p>Pathologist Dr. John Dwyer found the spleen was 3x normal size and the stomach was filled with blood. Toxicologists found no trace of any known poison.</p>

            <h4>III. THE HIDDEN SCRAP (TAMAM SHUD)</h4>
            <p>A scrap of paper was found in a hidden pocket reading <b>"Tamam Shud"</b> (Persian for "Ended"). It was torn from the <i>Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</i>.</p>

            <h4>IV. THE CAR & THE CODE</h4>
            <p>The book was found in an unlocked car. It contained a phone number for a nurse and a mysterious cryptogram:</p>

            <h4>V. MODERN BREAKTHROUGH (2022)</h4>
            <p>DNA testing identified him as <b>Carl "Charles" Webb</b>. Why he hid his identity and the meaning of the code remain unexplained.</p>

        <div style="padding: 20px; border-left: 2px solid black; margin-top: 10px;">
            <h2>CASE FILE #002: THE DYATLOV PASS INCIDENT</h2>
            <hr>

            <h4>I. THE EXPEDITION</h4>
            <p>
                In <b>January 1959</b>, a group of ten experienced hikers (mostly students and graduates from the Ural Polytechnical Institute) set out on a Grade III trek—the most difficult category—through the Northern Ural Mountains in Soviet Russia. The group was led by Igor Dyatlov. One member, Yuri Yudin, turned back early due to joint pain. The remaining nine continued toward the mountain Kholat Syakhl (translated by the local Mansi people as "Dead Mountain"). They never returned.
            </p>

            <h4>II. THE ABANDONED TENT</h4>
            <p>On February 26, 1959, searchers found the group's tent. The scene was inexplicable:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Slash:</b> The tent had been slashed open from the inside.</li>
                <li><b>The Gear:</b> All the hikers' belongings—boots, coats, and food—were still inside the tent.</li>
                <li><b>The Footprints:</b> Nine sets of footprints, made by people wearing only socks, a single boot, or completely barefoot, led away from the tent toward the woods in -30°C weather.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>III. DISCOVERY OF THE BODIES</h4>
            <p>The bodies were found in stages as the snow melted, revealing a progression of horror:</p>
            <p><b>The First Five (Hypothermia):</b> The first two bodies were found near a cedar tree at the edge of the woods, dressed only in underwear. Three more, including Dyatlov, were found between the tree and the tent, appearing as if they were trying to crawl back to safety.</p>
            <p><b>The Final Four (Trauma):</b> Found two months later in a ravine, these bodies changed the case from a tragedy to a mystery. Unlike the first five, these hikers died from massive internal injuries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Thibaul-Brignolles had a major skull fracture.</li>
                <li>Dubinina and Zolotaryov had massive chest fractures (equivalent to the force of a high-speed car crash).</li>
                <li><b>Missing Features:</b> Dubinina was missing her tongue, eyes, and part of her lips.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>The Medical Mystery:</b> Despite the shattered bones, there were no external bruises or soft tissue damage. It was as if their skeletons had been crushed by extreme pressure without the skin being touched.</p>

            <h4>IV. THE ANOMALIES</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Radiation:</b> Tests revealed high levels of radioactive contamination on the clothing of some victims.</li>
                <li><b>Orange Spheres:</b> Other hiking groups in the area reported seeing "glowing orange spheres" in the sky on the night the group died.</li>
                <li><b>The Skin:</b> Relatives at the funerals noted the victims' skin had a strange, deep "brick-red" or orange tan.</li>
                <li><b>The Camera:</b> A final photo found on a hiker's camera shows a blurry, glowing shape that some claim is a "yeti" or a military projectile.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>V. OFFICIAL & MODERN THEORIES</h4>
            <p>The Soviet investigation concluded that the hikers died due to a <b>"compelling unknown force."</b> In 2020, a new Russian investigation suggested a "Slab Avalanche."</p>
            <p><b>The Unsolved Holes:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Panic:</b> Why would experienced hikers flee a tent barefoot for an avalanche that hadn't happened yet?</li>
                <li><b>The Trauma:</b> An avalanche rarely causes the specific "internal-only" crushing injuries found in the ravine.</li>
                <li><b>The Infrasound:</b> A theory suggests "Karman vortex streets" (wind patterns) created a low-frequency sound that causes intense panic.</li>
            </ul>

        <div style="padding: 20px; border-left: 2px solid black; margin-top: 10px;">
            <h2>CASE FILE #003: THE HINTERKAIFECK MURDERS (1922)</h2>
            <hr>

            <h4>I. THE SETTING</h4>
            <p>Hinterkaifeck was a small, isolated farmstead located about 70 kilometers north of Munich, Germany. It was inhabited by the Gruber family: Andreas (63), his wife Cäzilia (72), their widowed daughter Viktoria (35), and her two children, Cäzilia (7) and Josef (2). Also on the farm was their new maid, Maria Baumgartner (44), who had arrived only hours before the murders.</p>

            <h4>II. THE PRELUDE: "THE PHANTOM IN THE ATTIC"</h4>
            <p>In the days leading up to the murders, Andreas Gruber began noticing strange occurrences that he reported to his neighbors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Footprints in the Snow:</b> He found tracks leading from the edge of the forest directly to the farm, but none leading back.</li>
                <li><b>The Newspaper:</b> He found an unfamiliar Munich newspaper on the porch that no one in the family had purchased.</li>
                <li><b>The Attic Noises:</b> He reported hearing footsteps in the attic and noticed that a set of house keys had gone missing.</li>
                <li><b>The Broken Lock:</b> Someone had attempted to pick the lock on the tool shed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Despite these warnings, Andreas never contacted the police.</p>

            <h4>III. THE MASSACRE</h4>
            <p>On the evening of <b>March 31, 1922</b>, the mystery reached its violent peak. It is believed that the killer lured the family members into the barn one by one.</p>
            <p>First Andreas, then his wife Cäzilia, followed by Viktoria and the young girl Cäzilia were all led to the barn and dispatched with a <b>mattock</b> (a pickaxe-like tool). The killer then entered the house and murdered the maid, Maria, in her bed and 2-year-old Josef in his cot.</p>

            <h4>IV. THE FIVE-DAY SILENCE</h4>
            <p>The most disturbing part of the case is not the murders themselves, but what happened after. The bodies were not discovered until April 4th.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Smokescreen:</b> Neighbors saw smoke rising from the chimney throughout the weekend.</li>
                <li><b>The Cattle:</b> The livestock had been fed and the cows had been milked.</li>
                <li><b>The Kitchen:</b> Evidence showed that someone had been eating meals in the kitchen and sleeping in one of the beds while the six bodies lay cold in the barn and house.</li>
                <li><b>The Dog:</b> The family dog was found tied up, unharmed, but barked incessantly until neighbors arrived.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>V. THE DISCOVERY & AUTOPSY</h4>
            <p>When the family failed to show up for church and the young Cäzilia missed school, neighbors investigated. They found the four bodies in the barn stacked on top of each other and covered with straw.</p>
            <p><b>Autopsy Notes:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Most victims died instantly from skull fractures.</li>
                <li><b>The Youngest Victim:</b> 7-year-old Cäzilia survived for several hours after the attack; she was found with tufts of her own hair in her hands, suggesting she had torn them out in distress while lying among her dead family.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>VI. THE INVESTIGATION & SUSPECTS</h4>
            <p>The police interviewed over 100 suspects, but no one was ever charged.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Lorenz Schlittenbauer:</b> A neighbor who was rumored to be the father of young Josef. He led the search party and handled the bodies before police arrived, which some saw as an attempt to destroy evidence.</li>
                <li><b>The "Ghost" Husband:</b> Rumors circulated that Viktoria’s husband, Karl Gabriel, had not actually died in World War I and had returned to exact revenge. However, fellow soldiers claimed to have seen him die in the trenches.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>VII. FINAL STATUS</h4>
            <p>The farm was demolished in 1923. During the demolition, the murder weapon (the mattock) was found hidden under the attic floorboards, right where Andreas had heard the footsteps. To this day, the identity of the person who lived in the attic and murdered the Grubers remains <b>UNKNOWN</b>.</p>

        <div style="padding: 20px; border-left: 2px solid black; margin-top: 10px;">
            <h2>CASE FILE #004: THE LEAD MASKS CASE (1966)</h2>
            <hr>

            <h4>I. THE DISCOVERY</h4>
            <p>On <b>August 20, 1966</b>, a young man flying a kite on Vintém Hill in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, discovered the bodies of two men. The scene was bizarre and appeared ritualistic.</p>
            <p>The two men were dressed in formal business suits and waterproof raincoats. They were lying side by side, partially covered by grass. Most disturbingly, both men were wearing <b>handmade lead eye masks</b>, the kind typically used to protect against radiation or intense light.</p>
            
            

            <h4>II. THE VICTIMS</h4>
            <p>The men were identified as <b>Manoel Pereira da Cruz</b> and <b>Miguel José Viana</b>. Both were electronic technicians from Campos dos Goytacazes. They were known to be "electronics hobbyists" who were interested in spiritualism and the possibility of communicating with extraterrestrials or spirits using scientific equipment.</p>

            <h4>III. THE LAST MOVEMENTS</h4>
            <p>On August 17, the men left their hometown saying they needed to buy materials for work.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Bus:</b> They traveled to Niterói and were seen arriving at 2:30 PM.</li>
                <li><b>The Shop:</b> They purchased waterproof coats from a local store.</li>
                <li><b>The Water:</b> They were seen at a bar where they bought a bottle of water. The waitress noted that Miguel appeared very nervous and kept checking his watch.</li>
                <li><b>The Hill:</b> Witnesses saw the two men in a Jeep heading toward the hill where their bodies would later be found.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>IV. THE EVIDENCE LOG</h4>
            <p>Police found several items near the bodies that only added to the mystery:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>The Lead Masks:</b> Crude, hand-cut lead shields intended to cover the eyes.</li>
                <li><b>The Notebook:</b> A small notepad was found containing several cryptic instructions in Portuguese: <b>"16:30 be at the agreed place. 18:30 swallow capsules, after effect protect metals wait for mask signal."</b></li>
                <li><b>The Water Bottle:</b> An empty bottle of mineral water.</li>
                <li><b>The Handkerchiefs:</b> Two towels used as padding under the masks.</li>
            </ul>

            

            <h4>V. AUTOPSY AND CAUSE OF DEATH</h4>
            <p>The autopsy was severely delayed, and when it finally occurred, the internal organs were too decomposed to provide a clear cause of death.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>No Violence:</b> There were no signs of struggle or external trauma.</li>
                <li><b>Toxicology:</b> No common poisons were found, but the test was limited. Many believe the "capsules" mentioned in the note were some form of drug or poison that the men took voluntarily.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>VI. THEORIES</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><b>UFO/Spiritual Contact:</b> The most popular theory is that the men were part of a group attempting to contact extraterrestrials or "interdimensional beings." They believed the lead masks would protect their eyes from the "blinding light" of the entities.</li>
                <li><b>The "Scientific" Experiment:</b> As electronics experts, they may have been experimenting with psychedelic drugs and electromagnetic frequencies to achieve a higher state of consciousness.</li>
                <li><b>The Third Party:</b> Some believe they were lured to the hill by a third person who promised them a supernatural experience, only to rob them (though no money was reported missing).</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>VII. FINAL STATUS</h4>
            <p>The case remains <b>UNSOLVED</b>. In 1967, the bodies were exhumed for further testing, but nothing new was discovered. The "mask signal" they were waiting for never came, or perhaps, it was the last thing they ever saw.</p>
